PIGG FACTS:
1. Pigs love carrots
2. Pigs are scared of snakes
3. Pigs are smart

It's nearly morning and I'm lying in my comfy bed. I'm thinking about the times when I am young (well I am still young, but anyway...).

Oh! I almost forgot to tell you the thing that started this whole adventure - I'm a PIG. But do not misunderstand me, I'm not one of those pigs that humans describe: stinky, dirty, ugly, and useless if not turned into bacon (which I sincerely disagree). Those are all legends that humans made up so that they don't have to pity us when we are turned into breakfast.

Pigs are usually clean, well before we bathe in mud, not to get clean but to get dirty so we will have a reason to go swimming. And pigs are VERY SMART. We are even one of the smartest animals on earth! Not counting humans (we never count humans).

But I am still a very unusual pig. I am not talking about me owning a castle and being a fan of "Justin Beaver". But I am talking about me ESCAPING A FARM! I didn't just break out, I did it the EPIC way: I hacked a computer and I used Einstein's theory E=MC2 (Elephant=Micro-Carrots in 2D)...
